                    <h2>"You're the BOSS"</h2>
                        <p>
                            Have you ever considered yourself to be the CEO of your own company? A company where you have employees that make money for you?<br>
                            If your answer is no, let me convince you that you <em>actually are.</em><br>
                        <p>
                            If you have any means of generating income, then <strong>YES!</strong> You<em> do</em> indeed have employees.
                        </p>
                        <strong><em>What do I mean?</em></strong><br>
                            If you begin to think of every heard earned dollar you have made and as an employee, whether if it's from your salary, a part-time job or a paper run,
                            then you'll begin to understand the working potential of your money. <br>
                        <p>
                            Take this for example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>
                                You let your employees do nothing all day.</strong><br>
                                Agreed, not having to boss anyone around or organise what work needs to be done is easy - 
                                <strong>but it won't make you any money.</strong><br>
                                <em>This is what its like when you keep your financial assets as cash.</em> </li><br>
                            <li><strong>You have your employees do simple easy tasks.</strong><br>
                                Sure, this is better than the previous scenario - 
                                <strong>but it's certainly not the best way to make your money work for you.</strong><br>
                                <em>This is what its like when you put your money into simple savings.</em> </li><br>
                            <li><strong>You have your employees do more complex tasks.</strong><br>
                                This is what most common folk concerned with their finances do -<br>
                                <em>This is what its like when you put your money into a savings account or term deposit with a competitive rate.</em> </li><br>
                            <li><strong>You have your employees complete more risky, niche and competitive jobs.</strong><br>
                                This is what most common folk concerned with their finances do -<br>
                                <strong>This is the best possible category, in my opinion to work your money.</strong>              
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <em>But Tim, what does this all mean? Do I have to be risky to have my money work harder for me</em><br>
                        In short, yes. However There are several approaches to this - these will be discussed individually in a later blog posts.<br>
                        <p>The main take away message is this: Stop axing your employees and laying them off needlessly, on the other hand, keeping your assets and doing nothing with them is worse.
                        Stop living life day to day working hard for the money, instead, allow money to work hard for you. <br>
